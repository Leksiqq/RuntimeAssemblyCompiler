The **Net.Leksi.RuntimeAssemblyCompiler** library allows you to compile and load assemblies while your application is running. This may be useful for testing.

All classes are contained in the `Net.Leksi.RuntimeAssemblyCompiler` namespace.

[Project](https://github.com/Leksiqq/RuntimeAssemblyCompiler/wiki/Project-ru) - the main class that does all the work of configuring and compiling projects.

[ProjectOptions](https://github.com/Leksiqq/RuntimeAssemblyCompiler/wiki/ProjectOptions-en) - sets the project configuration.

[OutputType](https://github.com/Leksiqq/RuntimeAssemblyCompiler/wiki/OutputType-en) - an enumeration whose elements correspond to the values of the property of the same name in the project file.

**Important:** the **.NET SDK** must be installed to work with the library!

It is also proposed to familiarize yourself with the demonstration projects:
- [Demo:WebApp](https://github.com/Leksiqq/RuntimeAssemblyCompiler/wiki/Demo-WebApp) - "Hello world" is a web application that is generated at runtime.
- [Demo:UnitTesting](https://github.com/Leksiqq/RuntimeAssemblyCompiler/wiki/Demo-UnitTesting) - a test set of projects that is used to test the library itself.
